## 5.2.4

### Find all flights that

All answers also available in [Script.R](Script.R)

1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

```R
flights %>% 
filter(arr_delay > (60 * 2))
```

2. Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

```R
flights %>% 
filter(dest == 'IAH' | dest == 'HOU')
```

3. Were operated by United, American, or Delta

```R
flights %>% 
filter(carrier == 'UA' |carrier == 'AA' | carrier == 'DL')
```
4. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)

```R
flights %>% 
filter(month >= 7 & month <= 9)
```

5. Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late

```
flights %>% 
filter( arr_delay > (60 * 2) & dep_delay <= 0)
```

6. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

```dotnetcli
TODO @CARL is this delayed > 1 hour at dep and then arrived dep - arr > 30 
```

7. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

```r
flights %>% filter(dep_time < (6 * 60))
```

### 2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?
    
    A: The second call is automatically dropped

### 4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with cases by default? How can you change that default?
```r
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

    It returned back all variables (headers, points whatever data scientist need to decided on one name), that contained the time in any form, I was a little shocked at the lack of case sensitivity. 


    Essentially the functions like contains (or helpers) let you do more while writing less code which everyone and their mothers is a fan of.

    You could also write the question as an excluder cause. Thus this now returns everything except for what is in time


```r
    select(flights, -contains("TIME"))
```

### 2. Compare air_time with arr_time - dep_time. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?

```r
flights %>% 
mutate(true_air = arr_time - dep_time) %>%
select(air_time, true_air)
```

    You would expect the 2 numbers to the same but they are not @TODO ask Carl

### 3. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

```r
flights %>%
select(sched_dep_time, dep_delay, dep_time,)
```

    the scheduled time + delay = dep_time, as one would expect

## 5.6.7

### 5. Which carrier has the worst delays?

```r
flights %>%
group_by(carrier) %>%
mutate(total_delay = dep_delay - arr_delay) %>%
summarise(mean_delay=mean(total_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
arrange(desc(mean_delay))
```

    AS, 15.8 mean_delay

## 5.7.1

### 3. What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?

'''r
flights %>%
mutate(total_delay = dep_delay - arr_delay) %>%
mutate(approx_hour = floor(sched_dep_time / 100)) %>% 
group_by(approx_hour) %>%
summarise(mean_delay=mean(total_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
arrange(mean_delay) %>%
select(approx_hour, mean_delay)
'''

    After making my own of grouping by hours in the second mutate function, I decided to sort by then check vrs those hours and I found that the aproxmate best time to leave is in the 23 hour (11pm) with average total delays being approx 2.27 minutes
